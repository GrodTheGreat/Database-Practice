# Database Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice Database Programming

## Projects
Languages
- SQL
- SQLite
- MySQL
- Postgres
- MongoDB
- NoSQL

### Project 1: Simple Database Setup and Basic CRUD Operations
**Overview:**
- Set up a basic database using SQLite.
- Create a table to store simple data (e.g., a contact list with name, phone number, and email).
- Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

**Skills Focus:**
- Understanding database schemas and tables.
- Writing basic SQL queries.
- Using SQLite for database management.

**Other Considerations:**
- Learn about primary keys and data types.

### Project 2: Advanced CRUD Operations and Data Validation
**Overview:**
- Extend the contact list to include additional fields (e.g., address, birthday).
- Add data validation (e.g., email format, phone number format).
- Implement search functionality to find contacts by name or email.

**Skills Focus:**
- Data validation techniques.
- Advanced SQL queries (LIKE, JOIN, etc.).
- Handling user inputs and ensuring data integrity.

**Other Considerations:**
- Basic understanding of indexing for search optimization.

### Project 3: Relational Database Design and Normalization
**Overview:**
- Design a relational database for a small library system.
- Implement tables for books, authors, borrowers, and loans.
- Normalize the database to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.

**Skills Focus:**
- Database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- Designing relational schemas.
- Foreign keys and relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).

**Other Considerations:**
- Use ER diagrams to visualize database structure.

### Project 4: Introduction to MySQL and Basic Web Integration
**Overview:**
- Set up a MySQL database.
- Create a web application that interacts with the MySQL database (e.g., a simple blog or todo list).
- Implement user authentication.

**Skills Focus:**
- Setting up and configuring MySQL.
- Basic web development (HTML, CSS, and a backend language like PHP or Python).
- Connecting a web app to a database.

**Other Considerations:**
- Basic understanding of HTTP and RESTful APIs.

### Project 5: PostgreSQL and Advanced Queries
**Overview:**
- Set up a PostgreSQL database.
- Create a more complex application (e.g., a movie rental system) with multiple related tables.
- Write advanced SQL queries (subqueries, window functions, CTEs).

**Skills Focus:**
- Advanced SQL querying techniques.
- PostgreSQL-specific features and optimizations.
- Database indexing and performance tuning.

**Other Considerations:**
- Learn about PostgreSQL extensions and custom functions.

### Project 6: Introduction to NoSQL with MongoDB
**Overview:**
- Set up a MongoDB database.
- Create a document-based application (e.g., a product catalog or a blog).
- Implement CRUD operations with MongoDB.

**Skills Focus:**
- Understanding document-based databases.
- Writing MongoDB queries (find, aggregate).
- Schema design in MongoDB.

**Other Considerations:**
- Learn about MongoDBâ€™s flexible schema and how to manage schema changes.

### Project 7: Real-Time Data with NoSQL
**Overview:**
- Use a NoSQL database to create a real-time chat application.
- Implement real-time updates and data synchronization.

**Skills Focus:**
- Real-time data handling (e.g., using WebSockets).
- NoSQL data modeling for real-time applications.
- Understanding eventual consistency.

**Other Considerations:**
- Explore other NoSQL databases like Firebase or Cassandra.

### Project 8: Data Warehousing and ETL Processes
**Overview:**
- Design a data warehouse for a sales analysis system.
- Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to populate the data warehouse from multiple data sources.

**Skills Focus:**
- Understanding data warehousing concepts.
- Designing star and snowflake schemas.
- Implementing ETL pipelines.

**Other Considerations:**
- Use tools like Apache Airflow for scheduling ETL jobs.

### Project 9: Database Performance Tuning and Optimization
**Overview:**
- Analyze and optimize the performance of a complex database application.
- Implement indexing strategies, query optimization, and caching.

**Skills Focus:**
- Performance tuning techniques.
- Query optimization.
- Using tools for monitoring and profiling database performance.

**Other Considerations:**
- Learn about database replication and sharding for scalability.

### Project 10: Full-Stack Application with a Mix of SQL and NoSQL
**Overview:**
- Develop a full-stack application (e.g., an e-commerce site) using both SQL (for transactional data) and NoSQL (for product search and recommendations).
- Implement features like user management, product catalog, shopping cart, and order processing.

**Skills Focus:**
- Combining SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Full-stack development skills.
- Data synchronization between different types of databases.

**Other Considerations:**
- Explore microservices architecture to handle different parts of the application.

### Additional Tips and Resources:
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (Node.js), PHP, and Java are commonly used for database-related projects.
- **Frameworks:** Django, Flask (Python), Express (Node.js), Laravel (PHP).
- **Tools:** SQL clients (DBeaver, MySQL Workbench), NoSQL clients (Robo 3T for MongoDB), ORM libraries (SQLAlchemy, Sequelize).
- **Learning Platforms:** Coursera, Udemy, freeCodeCamp, and Khan Academy offer excellent courses on databases and related technologies.
